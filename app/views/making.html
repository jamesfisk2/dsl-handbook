<h2 id="preparing-a-prevent-referral">

<span class="number">1. </span>Preparing a Prevent referral</h2>

<p>When making a referral consider the following questions. You may not know the answers to some of these questions but try to provide as much detail as possible when making a Prevent referral to support the assessment process. When making a referral you should ask yourself:</p>

<ul>

<li>how / why did the individual come to be noticed by your organisation in this instance?</li>

<li>does it involve a specific event? If so, what happened? Is it a combination of indicators? Describe them.</li>

<li>has the individual shown a sympathetic interest in hate crimes, extremism or terrorism? Consider any extremist ideology, group or cause, as well as support for 'school-shooters' or public-massacres, or murders of public figures.</li>

<li>is there something about the individual's mobile phone, internet or social media use that is worrying? What exactly? How do you have access to this information?</li>

<li>does the individual have contact with groups or individuals that cause you concern? Who? Why are they concerning? How frequent is this contact?</li>

<li>has the individual expressed a desire to cause physical harm, or threatened anyone with violence? Who? When? Can you recall what was said / expressed?</li>

<li>does the individual have any additional need, disability or special education need? If so what? Are these known or suspected?</li>

<li>are there any other safeguarding concerns about the individual's family, peer group, environment that concerns you?</li>

<li>have you discussed your concerns with the child/young person, parent or carer? If so, describe this. What does parental support look like? If you have not had a discussion, describe the parental or carer support (if known).</li>

<li>if these needs are not met, what may happen? What will the impact of this be on the child/young person (what are we worried about?)?</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="informing-the-child-young-person-parents-or-carers">

<span class="number">2. </span>Informing the child, young person, parents or carers</h2>

<p>The DSL should inform the child or young person that they are going to speak with their parents or carers and refer this to the local authority to see if they can provide specialist support.</p>

<p>The DSL should inform the parents or carers that a referral to their local authority does not amount to an accusation of criminality. Rather, it allows for a multi-agency safeguarding assessment to be conducted and vital support to be provided to help divert vulnerable people from engaging in harmful activity.</p>

<p>All practitioners should aim to gain consent to share information but should be mindful of situations where to do so would place a child or young person at increased risk of harm. Information may be shared without consent if a practitioner has good reason to do so, and if the sharing of information will enhance the safeguarding of a child or young person in a timely manner. When decisions are made to share or withhold information, practitioners should record who has been given the information and why.</p>

<p>If necessary, you may share information without the family's participation under the crime and disorder legislation which allows for information sharing to prevent crime.</p>

<p>DSLs should not assume a colleague or another professional will take action and share information that might be critical in keeping children or young people safe. They should be mindful <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2" class="govuk-link">that early information sharing is vital for effective identification, assessment and allocation of appropriate service provision</a></p>

<p>There is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-practitioners-information-sharing-advice" class="govuk-link">guidance to support staff who have to make decisions about sharing information</a>. This advice includes the seven golden rules for sharing information and considerations with regard to the Data Protection Act 2018 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation" class="govuk-link">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>

<p>Fears about sharing information must not be allowed to stand in the way of the need to promote the welfare and protect the safety of children and young people.</p>

<h3 id="abusive-parents-or-carers-and-i-am-worried-about-making-a-prevent-referral">

<span class="number">2.1 </span>Abusive parents or carers and I am worried about making a Prevent referral</h3>

<p>Safeguarding children and young people from extremism or radicalisation is no different to other types of safeguarding harms, many of which, are interconnected. At times, you may experience resistance or distress from parents and or carers when referring their child to children's services. It is good practice to listen to parents and carers in a safe space. Follow your existing procedures in these instances. If staff have any concerns about a child or young person's welfare, they are required to act on them immediately.</p>

<h3 id="parents-or-carers-seek-legal-representation-or-contact-the-media">

<span class="number">2.2 </span>Parents or carers seek legal representation or contact the media</h3>

<p>This is very rare, but the setting is advised to seek support from their local authority.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-referral-is-assessed">

<span class="number">3. </span>How a referral is assessed</h2>

<p>The police or the local authority safeguarding hub will undertake an assessment. Details of the submitted referral may be passed onto counter terrorism police who are trained and experienced in assessing vulnerability and delivering supportive interventions to safeguard individuals and protect the general public.</p>

<p>The police will begin assessing the case, partly to ensure that the individual is not already part of any open investigations. This assessment should be completed within 5 working days (Prevent Policing National Policy).</p>

<p>During the assessment period, other agencies can also conduct their own assessments and the setting or referrer should consider what they can do to provide additional support to the individual. <strong><a href="#_What_can_settings" class="govuk-link">What can settings or providers do to prevent and address the risk of radicalisation?</a></strong></p>

<p>I <img src="RackMultipart20220207-4-7qu66b_html_1d3d27136bb9fe7d.png" alt=""> f the referrer has not received an acknowledgement within one working day, the setting should contact Children's Social Care or any alternative agency to which the referral was made (Working Together to Safeguard Children).</p>

<p><strong>Referral process flowchart:

# 1</strong></p>

<p><img src="RackMultipart20220207-4-7qu66b_html_de9c50969e2b3a73.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If the case is passed to a Channel panel, the multi-agency panel members, including the police, will collectively assess the risk to an individual and decide whether the case should be adopted as a Channel case.</p>

<p>Channel panel members act to bring together different agencies into one meeting where there are concerns about a child, young person or a family. Statutory interventions could take place alongside the Channel process.</p>

<p>Channel works in a similar way to existing multi agency partnerships for vulnerable individuals. It is a voluntary process allowing parents or carers to decline the support for those aged up to 18 years old. In these instances, the child or young person will be signposted to other services, if appropriate.</p>

<p>Channel panels work with local partners to develop an appropriate individualised support package to reduce broader risks to the individual and to reduce the specific risk of extremism or radicalisation.</p>

<p>For more information, see the Channel and Prevent Multi-Agency Panel (PMAP) guidance - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) additionally the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ltai.info/" class="govuk-link">Lets Talk About It website offers guidance on Channel.</a></p>

<h1 id="support-after-a-prevent-referral">Support after a Prevent referral</h1>

<p>The multi-agency panel may decide that the referral is not appropriate for Channel support or other safeguarding services and is signposted back to the education setting. The Channel panel will identify and outline the particular areas of concern and the individual's vulnerabilities, which should be addressed. There may be suggestions about how these might be tackled but ultimately it will be for the education organisation or institution to define the supportive intervention. Advice can always be sought from local authority or Prevent policing teams.</p>

<p>The multi-agency panel may decide that the referral is not appropriate for Channel support and is signposted to other safeguarding services. It may become apparent that other needs are not being met and the child or young person can best be supported through other services.</p>

<p>The multi-agency panel may decide that the referral is appropriate for support available through Channel. Channel support is bespoke to the individual and the specific risks and vulnerabilities identified.</p>

<h2 id="channel-support">

<span class="number">4. </span>Channel support</h2>

<p>Participation in the Channel programme is confidential, and consent is obtained before Channel support is provided to individuals. Many types of support are available, addressing educational, vocational, mental health and other vulnerabilities. Ideological mentoring is common. Tailored support is provided based on the needs identified for an individual. The role of the Channel panel is to coordinate new activity through statutory partners and / or Channel-commissioned Intervention Providers, or oversee existing activity depending on what is most appropriate and proportionate for the case.</p>

<p>A Channel panel will review the progress of an individual in the Channel programme monthly. The panel decides that a person will leave the Channel programme when there is no further risk of radicalisation. Support to address non-radicalisation related concerns could continue in some cases and would be managed outside of the Channel programme.</p>

<p>People in receipt of support from the Channel programme, but who drop out, may be offered alternative forms of support by the local authority or other providers. In these circumstances, any risk of terrorism that they might present will continue to be managed by the police.</p>

<p>After an individual has left the Channel programme, their progress will be reviewed after 6 and 12 months and they may re-enter the Channel programme. If the individual shows further radicalisation-related concerns they can re-enter the Channel programme and receive further support at any point.</p>

<p>For more information, see theChannel and Prevent Multi-Agency Panel (PMAP) guidance.</p>

<p>Channel support could include:</p>

<ul>

<li>family support programmes</li>

<li>family therapy / CAMHS programmes; targeted youth support</li>

<li>crime prevention programmes</li>

<li>focussed theological / educational programmes</li>

<li>parenting programmes</li>

<li>ne-to-one or group counselling</li>

<li>behaviour support / anger management programmes</li>

<li>ne-to-one ideological support or mentoring is often delivered by a Home Office approved intervention provider who can build a rapport with the individual to discuss their views and understanding</li>

</ul>

<p>It is often beneficial to have theDSL (and the referrer, if different) attend the Channel panel. This allows the DSL to be part of the process in building an intervention or support plan for the child or young person. Additionally, the DSL can relay any relevant information from the setting's point of view and liaise with parents or carers and panel members to understand the basis for their decisions and discuss ways the education setting could support.</p>

<h2 id="parents-or-carers-turn-down-channel-support">

<span class="number">5. </span>Parents or carers turn down Channel support</h2>

<p>In these cases, the Channel panel members are best placed to suggest alternative services such as early help or another agency to provide support. In medium-risk cases, the individual may meet the threshold for a child in need service (section 17) from children's social care. If the voluntary channel process is refused but there remains a terrorism risk, the referral may be progressed by the police outside of the Channel framework.</p>

<h2 id="support-without-channel">

<span class="number">6. </span>Support without Channel</h2>

<p>If the local authority or police decide that the concern does not meet the threshold for early help or child protection services, you may need to think about what universal services the child or young person has access to and assess what additional support can be put in place.</p>

<p>The setting or provider could consider what support could be provided to an individual who does not meet the threshold for early help (including Channel) or child protection services. The following interventions may also support an individual who is being supported on Channel or has exited the Channel programme.</p>

<h2 id="whole-school-interventions">

<span class="number">7. </span>Whole school interventions</h2>

<p>To undertake a whole school intervention, settings should:</p>

<ul>

<li>review RSHE, SMSC and British Values curriculum for all learners</li>

<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teaching-online-safety-in-schools" class="govuk-link">embed online safety and digital literacy within the curriculum</a></li>

<li>provide opportunities for <a rel="external" href="https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/safeguarding-child-protection/how-to-have-difficult-conversations-with-children" class="govuk-link">safe place debates to discuss controversial issues</a>

</li>

<li>build resilience to exploitation/grooming/radicalisation lessons</li>

<li>support parents with parental controls and <a rel="external" href="https://goingtoofar.lgfl.org.uk/" class="govuk-link">online safety advice</a>

<li>ensure setting has an effective safeguarding policy and staff training policy for Prevent</li>

<li>educate staff about vulnerability to radicalisation and current extremist risks, individuals and narratives</li>

<li>reduce risk, especially for the most vulnerable - consider what the setting or provider can do to reduce vulnerability amongst at risk students.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="individual-interventions">

<span class="number">8. </span>Individual interventions</h2>

<p>Individual intereventions should include:</p>

<ul>

<li>discussions and support to family â€“ parental programmes</li>

<li>mentoring or buddy up system</li>

<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/bullying-at-school" class="govuk-link">bullying prevention which can reduce victimisation</a></li>

<li>diversionary activities such as extra-curricular clubs or sports</li>

<li>improving social skills â€“ communication, leadership, conflict solving, social problem solving</li>

<li>cognitive behavioural training â€“ managing anxiety or anger, problem solving and coping strategies</li>

<li>establishing a positive and supportive relationship with the individual</li>

<li>utilising emotional wellbeing and mental health initiatives, counselling or toolkits</li>

<li><a rel="external" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/748474/181008_schools_statutory_guidance_final.pdf" class="govuk-link">careers advice</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-exclusion" class="govuk-link">behavioural or attendance support</a></li>

<li>engagement with community groups or organisations</li>

</ul>

<p>Education settings may put in place protective interventions to support a vulnerable young person. This might be when no further action is taken by the police or local authority or it could be wider work delivered in the school or college when a learner is on Channel.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-2-how-a-referral-is-assessed---what-is-the-role-of-the-police-in-a-referral">

<span class="number">9. </span>Case study 2: how a referral is assessed - what is the role of the police in a referral?</h2>

<p>During a lesson, a 14-year-old student was seen accessing inappropriate material on his computer. The teacher in the class saw this and feeling that the material was school massacre related, shut down the website. The teacher asked the student about the material on the website, but the student just seemed evasive and angry. The teacher decided to report the incident to their DSL. The DSL had already received a number of safeguarding concerns from the student's other teachers, so chose to make a Prevent referral.</p>

<p>Once the referral had been sent to Counter Terrorism Police, the police searched their own records for any information that might suggest a vulnerability in the student to being drawn (coerced or groomed) towards extreme violence or any terrorism-related offending. The Police Prevent Officer also contacted the school and the teacher to talk through the details of the referral. The school had spoken to the child and parents and was able to provide further context.</p>

<p>If, as a result of this initial assessment, the Police Prevent officer reasonably suspects that the student might be vulnerable to being drawn towards <em>any</em> terrorism related offending, then the referral will enter the next stage of the process, for example looking to support the child through the Channel multi-agency process.</p>

<p>This stage took place, with police co-ordinating information gathering with statutory partners (e.g. local authority, education setting) in order to identify any further relevant information that would be enough to raise the initial concerns to a degree that suggests the student needs support and safeguarding within the Prevent programme.</p>

<p>In this case no vulnerability or ideological risks that may require Prevent support were identified.</p>

<p>Information sharing showed that the student was <strong>not</strong> being groomed by an extremist or violent group, and that the student did not seem to have a fixated or overly concerning interest in extremists, terrorists or ideological causes connected to school massacres. The website mentioned in the referral, although distasteful, had no terrorist concerns or links.</p>

<p>Although there were no Prevent relevant issues identified, information sharing did confirm that the student may have some mainstream safeguarding vulnerabilities in his home life.</p>

<p>To ensure that the correct support was put in place, the Prevent police referred the case to the multi-agency safeguarding hub (MASH) or local equivalent.</p>

<p>The school was fully updated through the mainstream safeguarding partner and they felt reassured that a full 'Prevent' assessment had been completed. Advice was also given by Police Prevent officers regarding re-referral should there be an escalation in concern.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-3-channel-support---abdu-islamist-ideology-secondary-age">

<span class="number">10. </span>Case study 3: Channel support - Abdu, Islamist ideology, secondary age</h2>

<p>Abdu is in year 7 and has been subject to bullying in the past. He has one brother who he didn't get on with, which made life difficult at home. His grandmother had recently passed away. He had no hobbies and spent a lot of time on the internet unsupervised.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened">

<span class="number">10.1 </span>What happened?</h3>

<p>The school referred the student into Prevent following comments made at school which suggested support for Daesh. He agreed with Daesh's views, including their use of violence and had a strong dislike of Christians.</p>

<p>Parents were supportive but found it difficult to steer the student away from the subject on which he had become fixated.</p>

<p>Student's online activity involved watching beheading videos.</p>

<p>The school felt that the student was at risk of being groomed online.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered">

<span class="number">10.2 </span>What support was offered?</h3>

<p>The multi- agency Channel panel adopted the case due to student's clear vulnerability. The DSL attended the panel, taking a proactive approach engaging with the process. Parents were also very supportive.</p>

<p>The Channel panel agreed upon and supported him through an Intervention Provider (IP), who held monthly sessions with the student and was able to build a good relationship.</p>

<p>Other forms of support included the 'Mates' club, offered through the Youth Service, and the National Citizenship Scheme which ensured he was less isolated and improved his confidence. It also encouraged personal and social development by working on skills like leadership, teamwork and communication.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes">

<span class="number">10.3 </span>What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>Abdu's first session with his intervention provider (IP) was very positive.</p>

<p>IP was able to explore this and answer Abdu's questions around the ideology, satisfying him with the answers.</p>

<p>Abdu felt less isolated, in part due to his engagement with the Youth service and the National Citizenship Service, as well as support from the school and parents.</p>

<p>Abdu was very grateful for the support he had received and commented that it had come to him 'just in time'.</p>

<p>The case was eventually closed by the multi-agency Channel panel, following a range of reviews to ensure positive sustainable outcomes moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-4-channel-support---charlie-extreme-right-wing-ideology-fe-age">

<span class="number">11. </span>Case study 4: Channel support - Charlie, Extreme Right-Wing ideology, FE age</h2>

<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>

<p>Charlie was a year 12 student and was referred to Prevent after making racial comments at college and openly talking about a risk to white British people from those of other religions and ethnicities, particularly Muslims. He would cross the road away from people whom he perceived to be a threat to him.</p>

<p>The Channel Coordinator in the local authority spoke with his parents. They felt that his thoughts had originated from the reporting of international terrorist attacks on television and in social media. He felt a sense of threat from a perceived risk of attack from Muslim people.</p>

<p>During the meeting the parents produced a Nazi armband, which they told the Channel Coordinator Charlie had bought when he had met with National Front members who were allegedly recruiting people into their organisation. Charlie had gone there knowingly, after communicating online. Charlie told the Channel Coordinator that he was a member of the Army cadets and that he played in a band.</p>

<p><strong>What support was offered?</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Parents were anxious about the behaviour of the young person and relationships between them and the young person were tense.</li>

<li>Children's Social Care undertook an assessment of need.</li>

<li>A social worker liaised with CAMHS as part of their assessment and it was confirmed he had previously been medicated for anxiety, but he did not attend the service anymore.</li>

<li>The family had a negative relationship with services due to previous experiences.</li>

<li>Channel Coordinator sought an Intervention Provider (IP) with Extreme Right-Wing knowledge, as well as experience of supporting young people.</li>

<li>Sessions took place with the young person and a trusting relationship was developed early on.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>What were the outcomes?</strong></p>

<li>The intervention was completed, and the family reported it had restored their faith in services.</li>

<li>The relationships within the family circle had improved and parents were confident that their son was back on a safe pathway with a focus in life.</li>

<li>After 11 months the case closed by which time Charlie had stopped engaging with Extreme Right-Wing groups.</li>

<span class="number">12. </span>Case study 5: Channel support - Josef, Extreme Right-Wing ideology, primary age</h2>

<p>Josef was in year 6. He refused to work with a group of children in the class, giving the reason, "it's because they are immigrants, they are nasty and not British". He became very angry when other pupils disagreed and argued that he was right because his older cousin had shown him YouTube videos of immigrants carrying out criminal acts. Josef had never said anything like this before.</p>

<p>The teacher challenged this behaviour. The teacher explored this by asking what Josef understood by the term 'immigrant' and why he thought the other students were "nasty and not British". He mentioned the YouTube video and the class, guided by the teacher, talked about how many people commit criminal acts â€“ this is not unique to one specific group of individuals.</p>

<p>The member of staff shared details of this incident with the DSL. The DSL had a further conversation with the pupil and discussed this with his parents. The parents were very supportive and agreed to discuss this with their child and the cousin. Josef showed remorse following a conversation with his parents.</p>

<p>The setting decided to embed and deliver lessons within their PSHE curriculum on prejudice, stereotypes and digital literacy.</p>

<p>The setting did not make a Prevent referral because there were no other contextual or vulnerability factors and the child had a positive relationship with his parents who were able to discuss this concerning behaviour. The child was not deemed vulnerable to radicalisation, but the DSL recorded this incident in case there was any escalation of risk.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-6-protective-intervention-by-education-settings---alex-unclearno-ideology-primary-age">

<span class="number">13. </span>Case Study 6: protective intervention by education settings - Alex, unclear/no ideology, primary age</h2>

<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>

<p>Alex was a year 5 student and lived with his dad who is terminally ill and his granddad. His mum left when he was younger.</p>

<p>Alex felt very isolated due to loss of mum and potential loss of dad. He watched a lot of inappropriate programmes and films and played a lot of video games of a violent nature. He recently moved to a specialist provider (PRU) due to his challenging behaviour and seemed scared that something will happen there. He made rudimentary weapons. The setting made a Prevent referral.</p>

<p><strong>What support was offered?</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The case was not adopted by the Channel panel and was signposted back to the setting because there were no counter-terrorism concerns.</li>

<li>The parent was not very supportive and did not want to engage with the setting.</li>

<li>The setting delivered online safety workshops with pupils.</li>

<li>All pupils were able to discuss their views and Alex engaged very well in this.</li>

<li>Further work was undertaken to tackle his fears and concerns through regular mentor meetings with a pastoral behaviour lead who put in place a behaviour plan.</li>

<li>The specialist provider continued to try and engage with dad and was able to speak to him about internet use and provided guidance on parental controls and supervision.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>What were the outcomes?</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>As a result of the work done to make Alex feel comfortable, he felt much more settled at the specialist provider and was not scared of what might happen there.</li>

<li>His dad's condition improved somewhat, and he was able to plan a holiday with him in the summer.</li>

<li>Time and a safe space were provided for him to discuss any concerns he had in the placement and his behaviour gradually improved. The setting felt confident they could manage his behaviour.</li>

<h2 id="case-study-7-protective-intervention-in-education-settings---alice-school-massacre-ideology-secondaryfe-age">

<span class="number">14. </span>Case study 7: protective intervention in education settings - Alice, school massacre ideology, secondary/FE age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-1">

<span class="number">14.1 </span>What happened?</h3>

<p>Whilst in year 11 at an independent secondary school, Alice had written a piece of English coursework in which she expressed Extreme Right-Wing views and glorified the Columbine shooters. Alice felt that the school had ignored the bullying she had suffered in previous years and decided that she would take things into her own hands. She had a plan to "kill the protagonists and take out anyone else who got in her way". This was expressed through her writing which was articulate, with references to the Columbine attack.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-1">

<span class="number">14.2 </span>What support was offered?</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p>The school spoke to Alice and she reassured them that she was not serious about her threat and was struggling with her mental health. The school discussed this with her parents and sought informal advice from their local authority Prevent team. There were no other concerns about Alice and mum was very supportive. The school put in place an action plan to support Alice in her last term and shared this with the college she planned to attend.</p>

</li>

<li>The college discussed with mum how Alice felt about being at college and the feedback was that she was 'loving college'.</li>

<li>Mum and the college agreed to not speak to Alice about what had happened at school and the college assured Mum that it had a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying.</li>

<li>Teachers were asked to observe for any changes in behaviour and peer groups.</li>

<li>Alice's Progress Coach ensured that regular 1:1s were taking place and she was made aware of the student led enrichment groups that were available.</li>

<li>Attendance and progression were monitored closely.</li>

<li>Alice joined the college's debating society and creative writing society.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-1">

<span class="number">14.3 </span>What were the outcomes?</h3>

<ul>

<li>The family stated that Alice had thrived and blossomed whilst at college.</li>

<li>She has expressed that she enjoyed having 'safe' places to discuss topical issues and to listen to differing views.</li>

<li>She has since successfully obtained an apprenticeship.</li>

<li>There were no Prevent related concerns raised at all during the Alice's time at college.</li>

"text": "\u003cp\u003eThe multi-agency panel may decide that the referral is not appropriate for Channel support or other safeguarding services and is signposted back to the education setting. The Channel panel will identify and outline the particular areas of concern and the individual's vulnerabilities, which should be addressed. There may be suggestions about how these might be tackled but ultimately it will be for the education organisation or institution to define the supportive intervention. Advice can always be sought from local authority or Prevent policing teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe multi-agency panel may decide that the referral is not appropriate for Channel support and is signposted to other safeguarding services.

Many types of support are available, addressing educational, vocational, mental health and other vulnerabilities. Ideological mentoring is common. Tailored support is provided based on the needs identified for an individual. The role of the Channel panel is to coordinate new activity through statutory partners and / or Channel-commissioned Intervention Providers, or oversee existing activity depending on what is most appropriate and proportionate for the case.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Channel panel will review the progress of an individual in the Channel programme monthly. The panel decides that a person will leave the Channel programme when there is no further risk of radicalisation. Support to address non-radicalisation related concerns could continue in some cases and would be managed outside of the Channel programme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople in receipt of support from the Channel programme, but who drop out, may be offered alternative forms of support by the local authority or other providers. In these circumstances, any risk of terrorism that they might present will continue to be managed by the police.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter an individual has left the Channel programme, their progress will be reviewed after 6 and 12 months and they may re-enter the Channel programme.

The teacher in the class saw this and feeling that the material was school massacre related, shut down the website. The teacher asked the student about the material on the website, but the student just seemed evasive and angry. The teacher decided to report the incident to their DSL. The DSL had already received a number of safeguarding concerns from the student's other teachers, so chose to make a Prevent referral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce the referral had been sent to Counter Terrorism Police, the police searched their own records for any information that might suggest a vulnerability in the student to being drawn (coerced or groomed) towards extreme violence or any terrorism-related offending. The Police Prevent Officer also contacted the school and the teacher to talk through the details of the referral. The school had spoken to the child and parents and was able to provide further context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf, as a result of this initial assessment, the Police Prevent officer reasonably suspects that the student might be vulnerable to being drawn towards \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e terrorism related offending, then the referral will enter the next stage of the process, for example looking to support the child through the Channel multi-agency process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis stage took place, with police co-ordinating information gathering with statutory partners (e.g. local authority, education setting) in order to identify any further relevant information that would be enough to raise the initial concerns to a degree that suggests the student needs support and safeguarding within the Prevent programme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this case no vulnerability or ideological risks that may require Prevent support were identified.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInformation sharing showed that the student was \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e being groomed by an extremist or violent group, and that the student did not seem to have a fixated or overly concerning interest in extremists, terrorists or ideological causes connected to school massacres.
