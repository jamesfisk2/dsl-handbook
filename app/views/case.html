<h2 id="case-study-1">Case study 1: managing risk of radicalisation - Tom, extreme right wing ideology, secondary school age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>

<p>Tom is in year 9 and was struggling. He had poor academic results, was facing family problems and felt he had limited opportunities. He had difficulties controlling his temper, which led to him getting into trouble at school and having fights with his peers. He regularly wrote and shared racist posts online. He was found to be researching an extremist group online and speaking to individuals online who supported this group. Tomâ€™s peers noticed this and told a teacher who raised this with the schoolâ€™s safeguarding lead. This incident prompted the school to make a Prevent referral.</p>

<p>It became clear that Tomâ€™s parents had recently divorced and he had no contact with this father. He had previously witnessed domestic violence in the family home. His mother found it difficult to challenge his behaviour. Tom had few friends, was very withdrawn and suspicious of others. He felt isolated and alone at school and had found a group of people online who accepted him.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered">What support was offered?</h3>

<p>Tom was offered support through the Channel early intervention programme. Tomâ€™s specialist Channel mentor worked with him to help him understand the narrow point of view he was holding, and the potentially damaging consequences of his beliefs. The school also put in place a mentor to support him with his studies.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes">What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>Over time, Tom began to understand different viewpoints and was less fixated on acting on his extreme views. The school reported an improvement in his behaviour and Tom felt he was able to control his anger. He became involved in air cadets and showed interest in becoming a pilot.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-2">Case study 2: how a referral is assessed - what is the role of the police in a referral?</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-1">What happened?</h3>

<p>During a lesson, a 14 year old student was seen accessing inappropriate material on his computer. The teacher in the class saw this and feeling that the material was related to school massacres, shut down the website. The teacher asked the student about the material on the website, but he just seemed evasive and angry. The teacher decided to report the incident to their DSL. The DSL had already received a number of safeguarding concerns from the studentâ€™s other teachers, so they made a Prevent referral.</p>

<p>The referral was sent to Counter Terrorism Police. They searched their records for any information that might suggest the student is vulnerable to being drawn (coerced or groomed) towards extreme violence or any terrorism-related offending. The police Prevent officer also contacted the school and the teacher to talk through the details of the referral. The school had spoken to the student and parents and was able to provide further context.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-1">What support was offered?</h3>

<p>After the initial assessment, the police assessed whether the student would need further support, such as Channel support. They co-ordinated the gathering of information with statutory partners, including the local authority and school, to find any information that would increase the initial concerns.</p>

<p>The police found no vulnerability or ideological risks that might require Channel support.</p>

<p>Information sharing showed that the student was not being groomed by an extremist or violent group. It also showed that he did not seem to have a fixated or overly concerning interest in extremists, terrorists or ideological causes connected to school massacres. The website mentioned in the referral, although distasteful, had no terrorist concerns or links.</p>

<p>Although the police did not find any issues relating Prevent, information sharing did confirm that the student may have some mainstream safeguarding vulnerabilities in his home life.</p>

<p>To make sure the correct support was put in place, the Prevent police referred the case to the multi-agency safeguarding hub (MASH) or local equivalent.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-1">What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>The mainstream safeguarding partner updated the school and they felt reassured that a full Prevent assessment had been completed. Police Prevent officers also gave the school advice about re-referral if they had further concerns in the future.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-3">Case study 3: Channel support - Abdu, Islamist ideology, secondary age</h2>

<p>Abdu is in year 7 and has been subject to bullying in the past. He has one brother who he did not get on with, which made life difficult at home. His grandmother had recently passed away. He had no hobbies and spent a lot of time on the internet unsupervised.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened-2">What happened?</h2>

<p>Abdu is in year 7 and had been subject to bullying in the past. He has one brother who he did not get on with, which made life difficult at home. His grandmother had recently passed away. He had no hobbies and spent a lot of time on the internet unsupervised.</p>

<p>Abdu made comments at school which suggested support for Daesh. He agreed with Daeshâ€™s views, including their use of violence, and had a strong dislike of Christians. The school referred Abdu to Prevent.</p>

<p>Abduâ€™s parents were supportive but found it difficult to steer him away from the subject on which he had become fixated.</p>

<p>Abduâ€™s online activity involved watching beheading videos. The school felt that he was at risk of being groomed online.</p>

<h2 id="what-support-was-offered-2">What support was offered?</h2>

<p>The designated safeguarding lead (DSL) attended the Channel panel, taking a proactive approach and engaging with the process. Abduâ€™s parents were also very supportive.</p>

<p>Abdu was clearly vulnerable and the Channel panel adopted the case.</p>

<p>The Channel panel agreed upon an intervention provider to support Abdu. The intervention provider held monthly sessions with Abdu and was able to build a good relationship with him.</p>

<p>Other forms of support included the Mates club, offered through the Youth Service, and the National Citizenship Scheme, which made sure Abdu was less isolated and improved his confidence. It also encouraged Abdu to develop personally and socially by working on skills like leadership, teamwork and communication.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-2">What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>Abduâ€™s first session with his intervention provider was very positive. The intervention provider was able to answer Abduâ€™s questions about his ideology and satisfy him with the answers.</p>

<p>Abdu felt less isolated, partly due to joining the Youth Service and the National Citizenship Service, but also support from the school and his parents.</p>

<p>Abdu was very grateful for the support he had received and commented that it had come to him â€˜just in timeâ€™.</p>

<p>The case was eventually closed by the Channel panel, following a range of reviews to ensure positive sustainable outcomes moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-4">Case study 4: Channel support - Charlie, extreme right wing ideology, further education age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-3">What happened?</h3>

<p>Charlie was a year 12 student at college. He made racial comments while in college and openly talked about people of other religions and ethnicities, particularly Muslims, being a risk to white British people. He would cross the road away from people who he saw as a threat to him. The college referred him to Prevent.</p>

<p>The Channel coordinator in the local authority at a meeting with Charlieâ€™s parents. They felt that his thoughts had come from the reporting of international terrorist attacks on television and social media. Charlie felt a sense of threat from a perceived risk of attack from Muslim people.</p>

<p>During the meeting, the parents produced a Nazi armband. They said Charlie had bought it when he met with National Front members who were allegedly recruiting people into their organisation. Charlie had gone there knowingly, after communicating online. Charlie told the Channel coordinator that he was a member of the Army cadets and that he played in a band.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-3">What support was offered?</h3>

<p>Charlieâ€™s parents were anxious about his behaviour and their relationship with him was tense. Childrenâ€™s Social Care carried out an assessment of need.</p>

<p>A social worker liaised with child and adolescent mental health services as part of their assessment. They confirmed that Charlie had previously been medicated for anxiety, but he did not attend the service any more. The family had a negative relationship with services due to past experiences.</p>

<p>The Channel coordinator found an intervention provider with extreme right wing knowledge, as well as experience of supporting young people. The intervention provider had session with Charlie and developed a trusting relationship early on.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-3">What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>The intervention was completed, and the family reported it had restored their faith in services.</p>

<p>The relationships within the family circle had improved and Charlieâ€™s parents were confident that he was back on a safe pathway with a focus in life.</p>

<p>After 11 months, the case was closed. Charlie had stopped engaging with extreme right wing groups.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-5">Case study 5: Channel support - Josef, extreme right wing ideology, primary age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-4">What happened?</h3>

<p>Josef was in year 6. He refused to work with a group of children in the class, saying: â€˜Itâ€™s because theyâ€™re immigrants, theyâ€™re nasty and not British.â€™ He became very angry when other pupils disagreed. He argued that he was right because his older cousin had shown him YouTube videos of immigrants carrying out criminal acts. Josef had never said anything like this before.</p>

<p>The teacher challenged Josefâ€™s behaviour. They asked Josef what he understood by the term â€˜immigrantâ€™ and why he thought the other students were â€˜nasty and not Britishâ€™. Josef mentioned the YouTube video.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-4">What support was offered?</h3>

<p>The teacher guided the class to talk about how many people commit criminal acts. They talked about how it is not unique to one specific group of individuals.</p>

<p>The teacher shared details of this incident with the designated safeguarding lead (DSL). The DSL talked to Josef and discussed this with his parents. His parents were very supportive and agreed to discuss this with Josef and his cousin. Josef showed remorse after his parents had spoken to him.</p>

<p>The school decided to embed and deliver lessons on prejudice, stereotypes and digital literacy within their personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) curriculum.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-4">What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>The school did not make a Prevent referral because there were no other contextual or vulnerability factors. Josef also had a positive relationship with his parents and they were able to talk to him about his behaviour.</p>

<p>Josef was not deemed vulnerable to radicalisation, but the DSL recorded this incident in case the risk escalated.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-6">Case study 6: protective intervention by education settings - Alex, unclear/no ideology, primary age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-5">What happened?</h3>

<p>Alex is in year 5. He lives with his dad, who is terminally ill, and his granddad. His mum left when he was younger.</p>

<p>Alex felt very isolated because heâ€™d lost his mum and was close to losing his dad. He watched a lot of inappropriate programmes and films and played a lot of violent video games.</p>

<p>Alex had recently moved to a specialist provider because of his challenging behaviour. He seemed scared that something would happen there and made rudimentary weapons. The setting made a Prevent referral.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-5">What support was offered?</h3>

<p>The Channel panel did not take on the case. They signposted it back to the school because there were no counter-terrorism concerns.</p>

<p>Alexâ€™s dad was not very supportive and did not want to engage with the school.</p>

<p>The school delivered online safety workshops with pupils. All pupils were able to discuss their views and Alex engaged very well in this.</p>

<p>A pastoral behaviour lead held regular mentor meetings with Alex. They put in place a behaviour plan to tackle his fears and concerns.</p>

<p>The specialist provider continued to try and engage with Alexâ€™s dad. They were able to speak to him about internet use and gave guidance on parental controls and supervision.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-5">What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>Alex felt much more settled at the specialist provider and was not scared of what might happen there.</p>

<p>Alexâ€™s dadâ€™s condition improved somewhat, and he was able to plan a holiday with him in the summer.</p>

<p>Alex was given time and a safe space to discuss any concerns he had in the placement and his behaviour gradually improved. The school felt confident they could manage his behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-7">Case study 7: protective intervention in education settings - Alice, school massacre ideology, secondary and further education age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-6">What happened?</h3>

<p>Alice was in year 11 at an independent secondary school. She had written a piece of English coursework in which she expressed extreme right wing views and glorified the Columbine shooters.</p>

<p>Alice felt the school had ignored the bullying sheâ€™d suffered in previous years and decided to take things into her own hands. She had a plan to â€˜kill the protagonists and take out anyone else who got in her wayâ€™. She expressed this through her writing, which was articulate and referenced the Columbine attack.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-6">What support was offered?</h3>

<p>The school spoke to Alice. She reassured them that she was not serious about her threat and was struggling with her mental health.</p>

<p>The school discussed this with her parents and asked the local authority Prevent team for informal advice. There were no other concerns about Alice and her mum was very supportive.</p>

<p>The school put in place an action plan to support Alice in her last term and shared this with the college she planned to attend.</p>

<p>The college asked Aliceâ€™s mum how Alice felt about being at college. She said Alice was â€˜loving collegeâ€™.</p>

<p>Aliceâ€™s mum and the college agreed not to speak to Alice about what had happened at school. The college assured her mum that it had a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying.</p>

<p>Aliceâ€™s teachers were asked to look out for any changes in her behaviour and peer groups.</p>

<p>Aliceâ€™s progress coach made sure that regular one to one meetings were taking place. They also told her about the student led enrichment groups that were available.</p>

<p>The college closely monitored Aliceâ€™s attendance and progression.</p>

<p>Alice joined the collegeâ€™s debating society and creative writing society.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-6">What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>Aliceâ€™s family said sheâ€™d thrived and blossomed at college. Alice said she enjoyed having â€˜safeâ€™ places to discuss topical issues and to listen to different views.</p>

<p>There were no Prevent related concerns raised during Aliceâ€™s time at college.</p>

<p>Alice has since obtained an apprenticeship.</p>

He had poor academic results, was facing family problems and felt he had limited opportunities. He had difficulties controlling his temper, which led to him getting into trouble at school and having fights with his peers. He regularly wrote and shared racist posts online. He was found to be researching an extremist group online and speaking to individuals online who supported this group. Tomâ€™s peers noticed this and told a teacher who raised this with the schoolâ€™s safeguarding lead. This incident prompted the school to make a Prevent referral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt became clear that Tomâ€™s parents had recently divorced and he had no contact with this father. He had previously witnessed domestic violence in the family home. His mother found it difficult to challenge his behaviour. Tom had few friends, was very withdrawn and suspicious of others.

The teacher in the class saw this and feeling that the material was related to school massacres, shut down the website. The teacher asked the student about the material on the website, but he just seemed evasive and angry. The teacher decided to report the incident to their DSL. The DSL had already received a number of safeguarding concerns from the studentâ€™s other teachers, so they made a Prevent referral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe referral was sent to Counter Terrorism Police. They searched their records for any information that might suggest the student is vulnerable to being drawn (coerced or groomed) towards extreme violence or any terrorism-related offending. The police Prevent officer also contacted the school and the teacher to talk through the details of the referral. The school had spoken to the student and parents and was able to provide further context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-support-was-offered-1\"\u003eWhat support was offered?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the initial assessment, the police assessed whether the student would need further support, such as Channel support. They co-ordinated the gathering of information with statutory partners, including the local authority and school, to find any information that would increase the initial concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe police found no vulnerability or ideological risks that might require Channel support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInformation sharing showed that the student was not being groomed by an extremist or violent group. It also showed that he did not seem to have a fixated or overly concerning interest in extremists, terrorists or ideological causes connected to school massacres. The website mentioned in the referral, although distasteful, had no terrorist concerns or links.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the police did not find any issues relating Prevent, information sharing did confirm that the student may have some mainstream safeguarding vulnerabilities in his home life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make sure the correct support was put in place, the Prevent police referred the case to the multi-agency safeguarding hub (MASH) or local equivalent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-were-the-outcomes-1\"\u003eWhat were the outcomes?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe mainstream safeguarding partner updated the school and they felt reassured that a full Prevent assessment had been completed.
