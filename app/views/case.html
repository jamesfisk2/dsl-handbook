<span class="number">1. </span>Case study 1: managing risk of radicalisation - Tom, Extreme Right Wing ideology, secondary school age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened">

<span class="number">1.1 </span>What happened?</h3>

<p>Tom is in year 9 and was struggling; he had poor academic results, was facing family problems and felt he had limited opportunities. He had difficulties controlling his temper, which led to him getting into trouble at school and having fights with his peers. He regularly wrote and shared racist posts online. He was found to be researching an extremist group online and speaking to individuals online who supported this group. Tom's peers noticed this online and shared this with a teacher who raised this with the setting's safeguarding lead. This 'incident' prompted the education setting to make a Prevent referral.</p>

<p>It transpired that Tom's parents had recently divorced, and he had no paternal contact. He had previously witnessed domestic violence in the family home. The mother found it difficult to challenge his behaviour. He had few friends, was very withdrawn and suspicious of others. He felt isolated and alone at school and had found a group of people online who were accepting of him.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered">

<span class="number">1.2 </span>What support was offered?</h3>

<p>Tom was offered support through the Channel early intervention programme. Tom's specialist Channel mentor worked with him to help him understand the narrow point of view he was subscribing to, and potentially damaging consequences of his beliefs. The school also put in place a mentor to support him with his studies.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes">

<span class="number">1.3 </span>What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>Over time, Tom began to understand different viewpoints and was less fixated on acting on his extreme views. The school reported an improvement in his behaviour and Tom felt he was able to control his anger. He became involved in air cadets and showed interest in becoming a pilot.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-2-how-a-referral-is-assessed---what-is-the-role-of-the-police-in-a-referral">

<span class="number">2. </span>Case study 2: how a referral is assessed - what is the role of the police in a referral?</h2>

<p>During a lesson, a 14-year-old student was seen accessing inappropriate material on his computer. The teacher in the class saw this and feeling that the material was school massacre related, shut down the website. The teacher asked the student about the material on the website, but the student just seemed evasive and angry. The teacher decided to report the incident to their DSL. The DSL had already received a number of safeguarding concerns from the student's other teachers, so chose to make a Prevent referral.</p>

<p>Once the referral had been sent to Counter Terrorism Police, the police searched their own records for any information that might suggest a vulnerability in the student to being drawn (coerced or groomed) towards extreme violence or any terrorism-related offending. The Police Prevent Officer also contacted the school and the teacher to talk through the details of the referral. The school had spoken to the child and parents and was able to provide further context.</p>

<p>If, as a result of this initial assessment, the Police Prevent officer reasonably suspects that the student might be vulnerable to being drawn towards <em>any</em> terrorism related offending, then the referral will enter the next stage of the process, for example looking to support the child through the Channel multi-agency process.</p>

<p>This stage took place, with police co-ordinating information gathering with statutory partners (e.g. local authority, education setting) in order to identify any further relevant information that would be enough to raise the initial concerns to a degree that suggests the student needs support and safeguarding within the Prevent programme.</p>

<p>In this case no vulnerability or ideological risks that may require Prevent support were identified.</p>

<p>Information sharing showed that the student was <strong>not</strong> being groomed by an extremist or violent group, and that the student did not seem to have a fixated or overly concerning interest in extremists, terrorists or ideological causes connected to school massacres. The website mentioned in the referral, although distasteful, had no terrorist concerns or links.</p>

<p>Although there were no Prevent relevant issues identified, information sharing did confirm that the student may have some mainstream safeguarding vulnerabilities in his home life.</p>

<p>To ensure that the correct support was put in place, the Prevent police referred the case to the multi-agency safeguarding hub (MASH) or local equivalent.</p>

<p>The school was fully updated through the mainstream safeguarding partner and they felt reassured that a full 'Prevent' assessment had been completed. Advice was also given by Police Prevent officers regarding re-referral should there be an escalation in concern.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-3-channel-support---abdu-islamist-ideology-secondary-age">

<span class="number">3. </span>Case study 3: Channel support - Abdu, Islamist ideology, secondary age</h2>

<p>Abdu is in year 7 and has been subject to bullying in the past. He has one brother who he didn't get on with, which made life difficult at home. His grandmother had recently passed away. He had no hobbies and spent a lot of time on the internet unsupervised.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened-1">

<span class="number">3.1 </span>What happened?</h3>

<p>The school referred the student into Prevent following comments made at school which suggested support for Daesh. He agreed with Daesh's views, including their use of violence and had a strong dislike of Christians.</p>

<p>Parents were supportive but found it difficult to steer the student away from the subject on which he had become fixated.</p>

<p>Student's online activity involved watching beheading videos.</p>

<p>The school felt that the student was at risk of being groomed online.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-1">

<span class="number">3.2 </span>What support was offered?</h3>

<p>The multi- agency Channel panel adopted the case due to student's clear vulnerability. The DSL attended the panel, taking a proactive approach engaging with the process. Parents were also very supportive.</p>

<p>The Channel panel agreed upon and supported him through an Intervention Provider (IP), who held monthly sessions with the student and was able to build a good relationship.</p>

<p>Other forms of support included the 'Mates' club, offered through the Youth Service, and the National Citizenship Scheme which ensured he was less isolated and improved his confidence. It also encouraged personal and social development by working on skills like leadership, teamwork and communication.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-1">

<span class="number">3.3 </span>What were the outcomes?</h3>

<p>Abdu's first session with his intervention provider (IP) was very positive.</p>

<p>IP was able to explore this and answer Abdu's questions around the ideology, satisfying him with the answers.</p>

<p>Abdu felt less isolated, in part due to his engagement with the Youth service and the National Citizenship Service, as well as support from the school and parents.</p>

<p>Abdu was very grateful for the support he had received and commented that it had come to him 'just in time'.</p>

<p>The case was eventually closed by the multi-agency Channel panel, following a range of reviews to ensure positive sustainable outcomes moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-4-channel-support---charlie-extreme-right-wing-ideology-fe-age">

<span class="number">4. </span>Case study 4: Channel support - Charlie, Extreme Right-Wing ideology, FE age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-2">

<span class="number">4.1 </span>What happened?**</h3>

<p>Charlie was a year 12 student and was referred to Prevent after making racial comments at college and openly talking about a risk to white British people from those of other religions and ethnicities, particularly Muslims. He would cross the road away from people whom he perceived to be a threat to him.</p>

<p>The Channel Coordinator in the local authority spoke with his parents. They felt that his thoughts had originated from the reporting of international terrorist attacks on television and in social media. He felt a sense of threat from a perceived risk of attack from Muslim people.</p>

<p>During the meeting the parents produced a Nazi armband, which they told the Channel Coordinator Charlie had bought when he had met with National Front members who were allegedly recruiting people into their organisation. Charlie had gone there knowingly, after communicating online. Charlie told the Channel Coordinator that he was a member of the Army cadets and that he played in a band.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-2">

<span class="number">4.2 </span>What support was offered?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Parents were anxious about the behaviour of the young person and relationships between them and the young person were tense.</li>

<li>Children's Social Care undertook an assessment of need.</li>

<li>A social worker liaised with CAMHS as part of their assessment and it was confirmed he had previously been medicated for anxiety, but he did not attend the service anymore.</li>

<li>The family had a negative relationship with services due to previous experiences.</li>

<li>Channel Coordinator sought an Intervention Provider (IP) with Extreme Right-Wing knowledge, as well as experience of supporting young people.</li>

<li>Sessions took place with the young person and a trusting relationship was developed early on.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-2">

<span class="number">4.3 </span>What were the outcomes?</h3>

<ul>

<li>The intervention was completed, and the family reported it had restored their faith in services.</li>

<li>The relationships within the family circle had improved and parents were confident that their son was back on a safe pathway with a focus in life.</li>

<li>After 11 months the case closed by which time Charlie had stopped engaging with Extreme Right-Wing groups.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-5-channel-support---josef-extreme-right-wing-ideology-primary-age">

<span class="number">5. </span>Case study 5: Channel support - Josef, Extreme Right-Wing ideology, primary age</h2>

<p>Josef was in year 6. He refused to work with a group of children in the class, giving the reason, "it's because they are immigrants, they are nasty and not British". He became very angry when other pupils disagreed and argued that he was right because his older cousin had shown him YouTube videos of immigrants carrying out criminal acts. Josef had never said anything like this before.</p>

<p>The teacher challenged this behaviour. The teacher explored this by asking what Josef understood by the term 'immigrant' and why he thought the other students were "nasty and not British". He mentioned the YouTube video and the class, guided by the teacher, talked about how many people commit criminal acts â€“ this is not unique to one specific group of individuals.</p>

<p>The member of staff shared details of this incident with the DSL. The DSL had a further conversation with the pupil and discussed this with his parents. The parents were very supportive and agreed to discuss this with their child and the cousin. Josef showed remorse following a conversation with his parents.</p>

<p>The setting decided to embed and deliver lessons within their PSHE curriculum on prejudice, stereotypes and digital literacy.</p>

<p>The setting did not make a Prevent referral because there were no other contextual or vulnerability factors and the child had a positive relationship with his parents who were able to discuss this concerning behaviour. The child was not deemed vulnerable to radicalisation, but the DSL recorded this incident in case there was any escalation of risk.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-6-protective-intervention-by-education-settings---alex-unclearno-ideology-primary-age">

<span class="number">6. </span>Case Study 6: protective intervention by education settings - Alex, unclear/no ideology, primary age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-3">

<span class="number">6.1 </span>What happened?</h3>

<p>Alex was a year 5 student and lived with his dad who is terminally ill and his granddad. His mum left when he was younger.</p>

<p>Alex felt very isolated due to loss of mum and potential loss of dad. He watched a lot of inappropriate programmes and films and played a lot of video games of a violent nature. He recently moved to a specialist provider (PRU) due to his challenging behaviour and seemed scared that something will happen there. He made rudimentary weapons. The setting made a Prevent referral.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-3">

<span class="number">6.2 </span>What support was offered?</h3>

<ul>

<li>The case was not adopted by the Channel panel and was signposted back to the setting because there were no counter-terrorism concerns.</li>

<li>The parent was not very supportive and did not want to engage with the setting.</li>

<li>The setting delivered online safety workshops with pupils.</li>

<li>All pupils were able to discuss their views and Alex engaged very well in this.</li>

<li>Further work was undertaken to tackle his fears and concerns through regular mentor meetings with a pastoral behaviour lead who put in place a behaviour plan.</li>

<li>The specialist provider continued to try and engage with dad and was able to speak to him about internet use and provided guidance on parental controls and supervision.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-3">

<span class="number">6.3 </span>What were the outcomes?</h3>

<ul>

<li>As a result of the work done to make Alex feel comfortable, he felt much more settled at the specialist provider and was not scared of what might happen there.</li>

<li>His dad's condition improved somewhat, and he was able to plan a holiday with him in the summer.</li>

<li>Time and a safe space were provided for him to discuss any concerns he had in the placement and his behaviour gradually improved. The setting felt confident they could manage his behaviour.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="case-study-7-protective-intervention-in-education-settings---alice-school-massacre-ideology-secondaryfe-age">

<span class="number">7. </span>Case study 7: protective intervention in education settings - Alice, school massacre ideology, secondary/FE age</h2>

<h3 id="what-happened-4">

<span class="number">7.1 </span>What happened?</h3>

<p>Whilst in year 11 at an independent secondary school, Alice had written a piece of English coursework in which she expressed Extreme Right-Wing views and glorified the Columbine shooters. Alice felt that the school had ignored the bullying she had suffered in previous years and decided that she would take things into her own hands. She had a plan to "kill the protagonists and take out anyone else who got in her way". This was expressed through her writing which was articulate, with references to the Columbine attack.</p>

<h3 id="what-support-was-offered-4">

<span class="number">7.2 </span>What support was offered?</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p>The school spoke to Alice and she reassured them that she was not serious about her threat and was struggling with her mental health. The school discussed this with her parents and sought informal advice from their local authority Prevent team. There were no other concerns about Alice and mum was very supportive. The school put in place an action plan to support Alice in her last term and shared this with the college she planned to attend.</p>

</li>

<li>The college discussed with mum how Alice felt about being at college and the feedback was that she was 'loving college'.</li>

<li>Mum and the college agreed to not speak to Alice about what had happened at school and the college assured Mum that it had a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying.</li>

<li>Teachers were asked to observe for any changes in behaviour and peer groups.</li>

<li>Alice's Progress Coach ensured that regular 1:1s were taking place and she was made aware of the student led enrichment groups that were available.</li>

<li>Attendance and progression were monitored closely.</li>

<li>Alice joined the college's debating society and creative writing society.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="what-were-the-outcomes-4">

<span class="number">7.3 </span>What were the outcomes?</h3>

<ul>

<li>The family stated that Alice had thrived and blossomed whilst at college.</li>

<li>She has expressed that she enjoyed having 'safe' places to discuss topical issues and to listen to differing views.</li>

<li>She has since successfully obtained an apprenticeship.</li>

<li>There were no Prevent related concerns raised at all during the Alice's time at college.</li>

He had difficulties controlling his temper, which led to him getting into trouble at school and having fights with his peers. He regularly wrote and shared racist posts online. He was found to be researching an extremist group online and speaking to individuals online who supported this group. Tom's peers noticed this online and shared this with a teacher who raised this with the setting's safeguarding lead. This 'incident' prompted the education setting to make a Prevent referral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt transpired that Tom's parents had recently divorced, and he had no paternal contact. He had previously witnessed domestic violence in the family home. The mother found it difficult to challenge his behaviour. He had few friends, was very withdrawn and suspicious of others. He felt isolated and alone at school and had found a group of people online who were accepting of him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-support-was-offered\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"number\"\u003e1.2 \u003c/span\u003eWhat support was offered?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTom was offered support through the Channel early intervention programme.

The school reported an improvement in his behaviour and Tom felt he was able to control his anger. He became involved in air cadets and showed interest in becoming a pilot.\u003c/p\u003e"

The DSL had already received a number of safeguarding concerns from the student's other teachers, so chose to make a Prevent referral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce the referral had been sent to Counter Terrorism Police, the police searched their own records for any information that might suggest a vulnerability in the student to being drawn (coerced or groomed) towards extreme violence or any terrorism-related offending. The Police Prevent Officer also contacted the school and the teacher to talk through the details of the referral. The school had spoken to the child and parents and was able to provide further context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf, as a result of this initial assessment, the Police Prevent officer reasonably suspects that the student might be vulnerable to being drawn towards \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e terrorism related offending, then the referral will enter the next stage of the process, for example looking to support the child through the Channel multi-agency process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis stage took place, with police co-ordinating information gathering with statutory partners (e.g. local authority, education setting) in order to identify any further relevant information that would be enough to raise the initial concerns to a degree that suggests the student needs support and safeguarding within the Prevent programme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this case no vulnerability or ideological risks that may require Prevent support were identified.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInformation sharing showed that the student was \u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e being groomed by an extremist or violent group, and that the student did not seem to have a fixated or overly concerning interest in extremists, terrorists or ideological causes connected to school massacres.

Alice felt that the school had ignored the bullying she had suffered in previous years and decided that she would take things into her own hands. She had a plan to \"kill the protagonists and take out anyone else who got in her way\". This was expressed through her writing which was articulate, with references to the Columbine attack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-support-was-offered-4\"\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"number\"\u003e7.2 \u003c/span\u003eWhat support was offered?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe school spoke to Alice and she reassured them that she was not serious about her threat and was struggling with her mental health.
